# IHUB-ML_CHALLENGE

The ML challenge was part of the selection process by IHUB IIIT Hyderabad to recruit interns capable in the field of Machine Learning
and Applications as well as Web Design and development with experience in working with one of the mainstream tech stacks such as MERN.

## About the Take Home Assignment:
The aim of the Take Home Assisnment is to check your understanding of AI-ML concepts, and consists of two simple questions. 
For each question you are expected to do the following:
1) Preprocess the data.
2) Analyse the data (Explain your understanding / observations)
3) Create a model and justify the results.

## Q1
Download the Amazon Fine Food Reviews Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv) and build a model to predict the sentiment of the review.

You must start with basic EDA and pre-processing (Explain each step of the model building process).

## Q2
Download the Flower Classification Dataset ("https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz") and build a model to predict the flower.

You should also show the following: 1) Display 4 samples of each type of flower 2) Convert images to grayscale and test the model. 3) Resize the images.

You must start with basic EDA and pre-processing (Explain each step of the model building process).
